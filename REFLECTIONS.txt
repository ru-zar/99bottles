I did start reading chapter 1 before I did this exercise. I also have seen Sandi
Metz's presentations and am familiar with "rush to green". I rushed to green as
quickly as I could and wound up in a similar place. I don't know every part of
Ruby, so I have `Array(to..from).reverse` instead of `from.down_to(to)`. I
didn't use a case statement, probably because `if` seemed less premature on the
first example that requires a conditional, and I just kept rolling with that
pattern. Also, squiggly heredocs are nice.

If I had to rationalize how I did it, I would say that lyrics are a cultural
and artistic phenomenon. This particular song does have an algebra about it,
but it seems nicest to computerize that simple algebra without trying to
model all of English inflections. Because even so, "No more" is a construction
that I'm not sure I would always use outside of this song. I might say "no"
or "zero". In other words, I wouldn't really be modeling anything outside the
scope of these lyrics. As long as I'm not doing that, treating the lyrics as
non-mathematical feels respectful to the song's author.

I have a broader "so what" feeling about this exercise. It might tell you
something about how to solve a nice tidy problem, but solving nice tidy
problems does not really describe my programming life these days. I spend
vastly more time trying to understand requirements and form them into tidy
problems to be solved.
